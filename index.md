# My Meme

When we were asked to create an original meme, I knew mine would rotate around parenting and my life as a mom 👩‍🍼.
There are so many unforgettable moments 🏆, big emotions 😆 😠 😢 and parenting fails 💩 to choose from - how could I __NOT__ pay tribute to them at all? 
I just thought my parenting life would be an incredible source of ideas and inspiration (and hopefully a laugh or two) 😜

My meme is a true story of my DS (dear son for those unfamiliar with Mommy message board lingo)
and I can assure you that at the time though, he was not. such. a dear.

Anywho, here he is.
