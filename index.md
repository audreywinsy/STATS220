# Hello ello!

This is my first (very simple) website and I am ***unashamedly*** proud of it for a few reasons:
- I don't consider myself a particularly tech savvy person

- I'm a *little* late to the party as a career changer in my mid-30s (Better late than never!)

- Now I feel like I'm not *"just a mum"*

### My Meme

When we were asked to create an original meme, I knew mine would rotate around parenting and my life as a mom 👩‍🍼.
There are so many unforgettable moments 🏆, big emotions 😆 😠 😢 and parenting fails 💩 to choose from - how could I __NOT__ pay tribute to them at all? 
I just thought my parenting life would be an incredible source of ideas and inspiration (and hopefully a laugh or two) 😜

My meme is a true story of my DS (dear son for those unfamiliar with Mommy message board lingo)
I can assure you though that at the time, he was not. such. a dear.
