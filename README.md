# STATS220

The purpose of this repo is to showcase some of the content I've created for this course.

Feel free to check out my [website](https://github.com/audreywinsy/stats220).

This is my ***first ever*** repo and I am ***unashamedly*** proud of it for a few reasons:
- I don't consider myself a particularly tech savvy person

- I'm a *little* late to the party as a career changer in my mid-30s (Better late than never!)

- Now I feel like I'm not *"just a mum"*
